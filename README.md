that is a java code for each SJF and Round Robin algorithms  
this code implements SJF & Round Robin algorithms in an easy way 
the code takes from the user number of processes and burst time for each process 
and the round robin also asks for the quantum time 
the code calculate the turnaround time for each process and average waiting time and the average turnaround time
